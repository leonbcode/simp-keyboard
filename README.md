SIMP is a simple macropad designed to optimize task automation. It features a 4x4 key matrix and an OLED display.

## About

SIMP is a hobby project that allows me to learn about microcontrollers and embedded systems. The project aims to create a simple and versatile macropad to enhance productivity. It's important to note that SIMP is a personal project developed for educational purposes. As I'm learning and improving my skills in microcontrollers and embedded systems, SIMP will evolve.

## Features

- 4x4 key matrix 
- OLED display 
- USB-C
- Compact and simple design

## Firmware

I am actively developing a dedicated firmware specifically for SIMP, which can be accessed at [simp-firmware](https://github.com/leonbcode/simp-firmware).

*Please be aware that the firmware is still a work in progress and primarily serves as a learning experience in embedded development.*
